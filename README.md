# Hi I'm Taylor Kuno. 👋 

I am an avid learner with a strong desire to continuously improve my skills. My current area of focus is the React/JS framework. I find that the component-based nature of React enables me to build highly readable, and easily expandable code bases. I love leveraging this framework to create applications with a responsive design and user-friendly experience.  
  
Find me rock climbing 🧗‍♀️, skating 🛹, drawing 🎨, or playing music 🎸.
